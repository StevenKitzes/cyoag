    <h1 class='center title dark-text no-gaps'>Component Design for CYOAG</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>This document describes the ReactJS component hierarchy for CYOAG.  This includes a description of the component state, on which
      the React component structure depends.  In other words, depending on the state of the top-most parent component, it will be decided
      which descendents will be rendered and what their content will be.  This can be thought of, in some sense, as a state tree, and
      that is how this component documentation will be structured.  Each node in this tree represents a component, and each branch
      from that node represents a potential data state.</p>
    <p>Using the top-most node as an example, we render the CyoagMain component.  If there is a session cookie on the page to begin with,
      then the CyoagMain component's children will be a story component and its children.  Otherwise, the CyoagMain component's children
      will represent login UI elements so that the user can log in and obtain a session ID, at which point the state will update so that
      the CyoagMain component will re-render with different children.</p>

    <h1 class='dark-text no-gaps'>State and Prop Design</h1>
    <p>Preliminary design for state and prop management on components</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3 class='medium-light-text no-gaps'>&lt;CyoagMain&gt;</h3>
        <p>The main component maintains the state for the entire application.  This is done by defining an admittedly complex state,
          as well as functions for modifying state, then passing the functions down to child components as props.  In many cases, child
          components will propagate these props down to their children as well.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, the main component will act not only as a state manager through which children can change state and initiate
          re-renders; the main component will also be the central point from which AJAJ(X) calls are made to the backend.  When a child
          needs to communicate with the backend, this will be done by proxy through the main component.</p>

        <p>No descendent of CyoagMain is intended to maintain its own state.</p>

        <p><strong>State</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class='no-gaps'><strong>nodeId</strong> - the ID of the current node for positioning</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class='no-gaps'><strong>reviewSnippet</strong> - the trailing end of the previous node, as a reminder</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class='no-gaps'><strong>lastPathSnippet</strong> - path snippet chosen to lead to the current node</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class='no-gaps'><strong>nodeSnippet</strong> - main plot text for the current node</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class='no-gaps'><strong>loggedIn</strong> - simple Boolean to track whether a user is logged in</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class='no-gaps'><strong>votificationStatus</strong> - whether the current user regards the current node with positive,
              negative, or neutral sentiment</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class='no-gaps'><strong>pathsCollapsed</strong> - whether paths should appear collapsed or expanded</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class='no-gaps'><strong>pathList</strong> - a list of all paths out from the given node, sorted by votification, and
              displayed collapsed or uncollapsed based on the <em>pathsCollapsed</em> state</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class='no-gaps'><strong>authoringCollapsed</strong> - whether authoring should appear collapsed or expanded</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class='no-gaps'><strong>options</strong> - JSON object listing usage options (feature planning in ideation)</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Props</strong></p>

        <p>No props are used by the CyoagMain component.  It only maintains state, and passes properties of its state down to its
          descendents as props of their own.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
