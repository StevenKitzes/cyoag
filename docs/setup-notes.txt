Setup and Installation Notes:
=============================

Regarding HTTPS setup:
To set up the CYOAG server, you will want to have HTTPS enabled since the NodeJS
project expects it.

First you need Let's Encrypt for free certificate authority access

To get the certbot:
$ sudo apt-get install letsencrypt

To use the certbot:
$ letsencrypt certonly --webroot -w /home/cyoag/server/public -d cyoag.com -d www.cyoag.com
