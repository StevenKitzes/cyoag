Setup and Installation Notes:
=============================

Regarding HTTPS setup:
To set up the CYOAG server, you will want to have HTTPS enabled since the NodeJS
project expects it.

First you need Let's Encrypt for free certificate authority access

To get the certbot:
$ sudo apt-get install letsencrypt

To use the certbot:
$ letsencrypt certonly --webroot -w /home/cyoag/server/public -d cyoag.com -d www.cyoag.com

The Let's Encrypt script output will tell you where it has placed the new key/cert files you need to reference in creating your ExpressJS server.

Command to run using an 'npm start script':
pm2 start npm --name [your app name] -- [npm start script name, e.g. start]
