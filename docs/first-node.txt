Thom Lacker awoke to the sound of rain coming down in sheets, hammering the street below his second story apartment. He prayed he'd fall back asleep, head pounding with last night's whiskey, but the thin line of drool trailing down to a puddle at his cheek dragged him, unwilling, toward an awareness of reality. Rolling away with a disgusted grimmace, Thom wiped his face dry with a clumsy swipe of his wrist. He cringed at the shock of cold as his arm escaped the warmth of his blankets, and with a cavernous groan, he tugged the sheets close about his neck. The space between the bed and his nearest piece of clothing was a chasm.

Memories began to surface, woefully clear through the aftermath of last night's bottle. He'd walked home alone from the docks, still sober then. Night had fallen early on the horizon, the sun's light choking on a smoke black, fast moving cloud front that promised a monumental downpour. Thom hadn't wanted to get caught in that, so he'd been openly irritated at the local monk who stopped him in the street to elucidate him on the meaning of life.

Not one to offend, Thom had offered a weak apology for his lack of interest and tried to sidestep the bubbly little man. But the monk persisted, following and tugging on Thom's sleeves until he accepted a leaflet produced from the layered folds of the monk's faded, blue woolens. Thom thanked the monk gruffly, tugging his elbow free and stuffing the leaflet into a pocket without a glance. He made it home just as the sky opened up.

Slamming the door shut with a sigh, Thom paused at the sound of paper scraping the wooden floor beneath his booted foot. He bent to pick it up, flicking off the hood of his coat as he struggled to make out the eloquent, but hastily hand-written note. It was a job offer of sorts, light on details. A vague request for information on a person of interest, who would be found at a particular location, at a particular time. Thom had worked with less, but he preferred to work with more. What caught his attention, though, was the compensation. \"This will be as memorable for you as it will be profitable,\" read the note. \"The money will be good, but you'll come away with so much more than that when all is said and done.\"

Notes slipped under the door were a common occurrence, unfortunately. Thom didn't have an office, and too many people had learned where they could find him when they needed his unusual talents. It wasn't ideal to have strangers calling at home, but he needed the work. It was too depressing to think of himself as out of a job, so he fancied himself a freelancer, between contracts. Either way, the simple fact was if he didn't take this job, he wouldn't eat next week. It had been suggested that he could eat twice as well if he drank half as much, but that was a demon for another day.

And so he found himself staggering into the gray light of a bitter, winter morning, despite the penetrating cold and a hangover for the ages. His long, hooded coat and knee high boots kept the worst of the driving rain off, but some seeped in through time-worn seams in the treated leather. What kind of pathetic, desperate sucker, Thom thought to himself, would be out on the prowl in this maelstrom? He shivered, stumbling onward and scowling at himself, hoping he wouldn't catch cold from all this. Wouldn't be any jobs he could take laid up with a fever.

At last, his destination came into view, a multi-story inn of old fashioned style, looming dark in the tempest. He stopped several dozen paces away and ducked into a narrow alley across the street, both to dodge the wind and to obscure himself from the casual observer. Thom waited as the rain poured over a broad awning that kept the walkway in front of the inn relatively dry. Stuffing his hands into his pockets, he found a crumpled, wet scrap of paper lurking in the depths of his coat, and pulled it free. The monk's leaflet, soaked but still legible. \"Find your way,\" it began, \"follow the path.\" Almost comically stereotypical. Included was a hand drawn picture of a man in blue robes, smiling broadly, his left arm outstretched to guide the reader onward.

Thom looked up to see a well dressed man coming down the street under the awning, and an equally well dressed woman emerging from the inn. Thom couldn't make out faces or voices in the storm, but the two met with body language that spoke of cautious formality. They shook hands, exchanged inaudible words, and just as quickly both went their own ways, the man turning down a side street and the woman heading up the way the man had come.

Thom panicked. Which was the target? The man was striding out of view, collar held up against the wind, and the woman was disappearing up the street into the tempest. Thom glanced down at the crumpled leaflet in his hand, at the monk with his arm outstretched to his left, Thom's right. Jaw set, brow furrowed, hangover thundering in his skull, he looked up and made the call.
