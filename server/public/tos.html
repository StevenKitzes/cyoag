      <h4>Preamble</h4>

      <p>Thanks for visiting the Create Your Own Adventure Game (CYOAG) site and showing interest in my project.  I want to be
        as transparent and fair as possible to everyone who wants to enjoy and collaborate on a project like mine.  I
        want you to know what your rights are, but I also want you to know what your responsibilities are should you choose
        to use the service that I've spent cold hard cash and many hours of my life creating out of a passion project.  Most
        reasonable folks will probably find everything written below to be common sense, but since we do have a lot of
        jackasses running around these days, I (like many before me) have to provide something like this to protect
        myself.</p>

      <h4>Agreement</h4>

      <p>This agreement constitutes a legal contract between you and CYOAG and CYOAG's owner (me). You acknowledge that you
        have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  If you do not agree with the terms
        laid out in this agreement, I do not permit you to use CYOAG.  Please also have a look at the CYOAG
        <a class='cyoag-link' href='usage.html'>policy outline</a>, as well.  It describes in brief many of the policies and
        philosophies that have guided me in the development of this site.  You may also be interested in the official CYOAG
        <a class='cyoag-link' href='priv-pol.html'>Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h4>Access</h4>

      <p>CYOAG may at any time and with or without notice, suspend or terminate service, and/or your user account,
        including as a result of any violations of this agreement found to have been made using your account, or
        for any other reason judged necessary by a member of the CYOAG moderation, development, or maintenance teams.
        A member of the CYOAG moderation team may also remove or modify any content you submit to
        this site in response to any agreement violation or perceived content guideline violations found in said
        content.</p>

      <p>The volunteer CYOAG moderation team reserves the right to monitor CYOAG content, and your use
        of the CYOAG service implies that you agree to such monitoring.  This reserved right does not imply on the part
        of CYOAG that all content and activity will be monitored at all times.</p>

      <h4>The CYOAG site and service ("CYOAG", "service") are provided for your personal, lawful use</h4>

      <p>The CYOAG service is designed, built, and supported for personal use only.  You are not permitted to use CYOAG
        to break the law, to violate another individual's privacy, or to infringe any person or entity’s intellectual
        property, copyright, or any other proprietary rights. (Duh.)</p>

      <h4>CYOAG is provided for entertainment and educational purposes</h4>

      <p>CYOAG is built and provided to be a place for entertainment and artistic expression.  CYOAG claims and accepts no
        responsibility for any decisions you make based on anything you read on CYOAG.  In other words, no content
        found on CYOAG should be interpreted as advice or instruction for any activity or behavior outside the
        bounds of the use of the CYOAG service.</p>

      <h4>CYOAG is not a public marketplace</h4>

      <p>You are not permitted to buy or sell any products via the CYOAG service.  That is not what this service is for.
        You are especially forbidden from conducting transactions for any illegal goods or services.</p>

      <h4>Registered CYOAG accounts and cookies</h4>

      <p>The CYOAG service uses browser cookies to track your activity on the CYOAG site, and in an attempt to make your
        experience as smooth and enjoyable as possible, whether you have a registered user account or not.  Anyone can
        read public content on CYOAG for free, and your location on the site will be preserved through the use of cookies.</p>

      <p>In order to contribute to CYOAG in terms of content contribution and voting on content, and in order to have your
        location on the CYOAG site preserved across login sessions and devices, you must create a registered account
        ("account") using a linked social media account, currently including either Facebook or Twitter.  You can find
        more details on this and related policies <a class='cyoag-link' href='usage.html'>here</a>.  You are discouraged,
        but not forbidden, from creating multiple CYOAG accounts.</p>

      <p>The only information the CYOAG service will retain with respect to your account is a random account name that you may
        choose to modify yourself; your position on the site; posts associated with your account; and a unique identifier key
        that links your social media account to your CYOAG account.  You are solely responsible for the information
        associated with your account and anything that your account is used to do on the CYOAG service.</p>

      <p>You are not permitted to license, transfer, sell, or assign your account to another individual or entity without
        the express, written approval of a member of the CYOAG team.</p>

      <h4>CYOAG content</h4>

      <p>CYOAG contains original text, images, software, code, website compilation, and website "look and feel" that were
        created specifically to design, build, and support the functions of the CYOAG service.  These shall be referred to
        as "CYOAG content."  CYOAG content is protected by the GNU GPL v3.0 open source license, as described
        <a class='cyoag-link' href='http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html'>here</a>.

      <h4>User generated content on CYOAG</h4>

      <p>You shall retain the rights to your original, copyrighted content that you submit to CYOAG (your "user content")
        except that by submitting user content to CYOAG, you grant CYOAG a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable,
        non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform,
        or publicly display your user content in any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to
        authorize others to do so.</p>

      <p>You further agree that you have the right to submit anything that you post, and that user content that you post
        does not violate the copyright, trademark, trade secret, or any other personal or proprietary right of any other
        party.</p>

      <h4>CYOAG does not endorse user content</h4>

      <p>CYOAG takes no responsibility for, and does not expressly or implicitly endorse, and does not assume any
        liability for any user content submitted by you to CYOAG.</p>

      <h4>Links posted on CYOAG</h4>

      <p>You are discouraged, but not forbidden, from including URLs (web addresses) in your content.  CYOAG
        accepts no responsibility for the content or actions of any third party websites or services associated
        with URLs, websites, or addresses shared or mentioned in or by any user on CYOAG. You agree to accept sole
        legal responsibility for any URLs or links you post in your user content, and neither this agreement nor
        our privacy policy applies to any content on other websites related to those links or URLs. You should
        consult the terms and privacy policies of those other websites to understand your rights and responsibilities
        there.</p>

      <h4>CYOAG rules and your participation</h4>

      <p>You agree to follow the CYOAG content policy. These guidelines are intended to keep people safe,
        protect children, keep CYOAG running smoothly without outages, and to encourage personal responsibility
        for what you do on CYOAG.</p>

      <p>You agree that CYOAG accepts no responsibility for the actions taken or not taken by volunteer moderators,
        acting in their best judgment to enforce the rules of CYOAG.</p>

      <p>The moderator position is voluntary and unofficial. Moderators are not employees or agents of CYOAG. CYOAG
        reserves the right to revoke that position for any user at any time. If you choose to become a moderator,
        you agree to the following: you may not enter into any form of agreement on behalf of CYOAG, without the
        written approval of a legal agent of CYOAG; you may not carry out moderation actions in return for any form
        of compensation or favor from third-parties; when you receive notice of content that violates this agreement,
        you agree to remove or modify it as appropriate.</p>

      <p>You may not post any text or other material that could be deemed to be junk or spam. Cluttering the CYOAG
        site with junk or spam content lowers the quality of the CYOAG experience for others. A good rule of thumb
        is that advertisement and self-promotion are forbidden.  There is a fine line between advertisement and
        subtle endorsement.  Use common sense; remember that violating content may be modified or removed at the
        discretion of a CYOAG agent or volunteer moderator.</p>

      <p>You are permitted to delete or edit your user content on CYOAG only if no other user content has been appended
        to the user content you wish to edit or delete. This rule is intended to respect the effort made by users who
        have added content following your content.  For example, if you edit your content, then content that follows
        may no longer make sense in the modified context; this could render entire story branches ruined, and we don't
        want that.  Only moderators may modify or delete user content that has other user content following it.</p>

      <h4>Don’t attack CYOAG</h4>

      <p>You agree not to interrupt the CYOAG service, introduce malicious code onto CYOAG, make it difficult for
        anyone else to use CYOAG due to your actions, attempt to manipulate votes or the CYOAG systems, or assist
        anyone in misusing CYOAG in any way. It takes a lot of work (and even a little bit of money) to build,
        maintain, and provide to you a passion project like this on my own. Please be nice in return.</p>

      <p>CYOAG is happy to hear responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a security issue,
        please use the email form found <a class='cyoag-link' href='usage.html#contact'>here</a>.</p>

      <h4>Underage access</h4>

      <p>It is not suggested that CYOAG be used by people under the age of 13, and CYOAG does not knowingly collect
        any personal information from such people.</p>

      <h4>Copyright</h4>

      <p>CYOAG will be happy to cooperate with legitimate requests under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
        ("DMCA"), and retains the right to remove user content on CYOAG that is deemed by CYOAG to be infringing
        the copyright of others. If you become aware of user content on CYOAG that infringes your copyright rights,
        you may submit a properly formatted DMCA request (see 17 U.S.C. § 512) to CYOAG
        <a class='cyoag-link' href='usage.html#contact'>here</a>.  Please include:</p>

      <p>Please remember that misrepresentations of infringement can result in liability for monetary damages.
        You may want to consult an attorney before taking any action pursuant to the DMCA.</p>

      <p>CYOAG enforces a policy to close (ban) accounts that are identified as repeat infringers. This policy
        shall be applied at the discretion of a CYOAG agent and in appropriate circumstances, such as when a
        user has repeatedly been charged with infringing the copyrights or other intellectual property rights.</p>

      <h4>A few more items</h4>

      <p>Everything you do and all the information you submit to CYOAG remain your responsibility. You agree that
        you will not hold us legally liable for any of your user content or actions that infringe the law or the
        rights of a third party or person in any way.</p>

      <p>Specifically, you also agree to hold CYOAG, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and
        third party service providers harmless from and defend them against any claims, costs, damages, losses,
        expenses, and any other liabilities, including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or related to
        your access to or use of CYOAG, your violation of this user agreement, and/or your violation of the
        rights of any third party or person.</p>

      <p>By way of disclaimer, CYOAG is provided for free, "as is," and without any warranty of any kind. To the
        maximum extent permitted by law, CYOAG and CYOAG's affiliates and third party service providers disclaim
        any and all warranties, express or implied, whether oral or electronic. You are solely
        responsible for any damage to your computer or mobile device, loss of use, or loss of your user content.
        We do not guarantee that reddit will always work properly.</p>

      <p>CYOAG will not be liable for any damages arising out of, or in any way
        connected with, this agreement or your use of, or attempt to use, CYOAG; including (but not limited to)
        damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data.</p>

      <p>You agree to release CYOAG, CYOAG's affiliates, and third-party service providers, and each
        associated director, employee, agent, and officer of CYOAG, from claims, demands and damages (actual
        and consequential), of every kind and nature, known and unknown, disclosed or undisclosed, arising
        out of or in any way connected to your use of CYOAG.</p>

      <p>I genuinely want you and others to enjoy CYOAG, so if any issue or dispute arises, please agree to raise
        it and try to resolve it with me informally first.  I vow and swear to do my part to ensure that everyone
        is as happy as they can be with CYOAG and the service it provides. You can contact me with feedback and
        concerns <a class='cyoag-link' href='usage.html#contact'>here</a>.</p>

      <p>The headings in this agreement are for convenience and do not control any of its provisions.</p>

      <p>If any provision of this user agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be modified
        to the extent necessary to render it enforceable without losing its intent. If no such modification is
        possible, that provision will be severed from the rest of this agreement.  A lack of enforcement of any
        right or provision in this user agreement does not constitute a waiver of CYOAG's right to do so in the
        future. This user agreement is the entire agreement between you and CYOAG concerning CYOAG. It supersedes
        all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and CYOAG. CYOAG may modify this user agreement at
        any time. If CYOAG makes changes to this agreement that materially affect your rights, CYOAG will provide
        advance notice and keep this edition available as an archive on the CYOAG website. By continuing to use
        CYOAG after a change to this agreement, you agree to those changes.</p>
