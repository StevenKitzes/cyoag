      <h3 id='writeNice'>Write Nicely (The Rules)</h3>

      <p>We won't ask you to only write G-rated material, but please be reasonable on this publicly available website.
        Kids may stumble across it.  Please aim for PG-13 or soft R rated material if you really need to go there, if
        it drives the trajectory of your story; there is no need to write explicit acts or extreme gore, to make your
        point.  And if that is your point, unfortunately, you'll have to make your point elsewhere.  It's not censorship,
        you may say what you want to say, but say it in a way that makes sense for this venue.  Please.  I'd prefer to
        ban as few people as possible.</p>

      <h3 id='sso'>Accounts Registered with Social Media Sign-in</h3>

      <p>In short, CYOAG pledges <em>never</em> to use <em>any</em> personal or account information from your social
        sign-in account, or to post or interact in any way on social media on your behalf.  Not even your name!  In
        fact, we pledge never to even collect or see this information.  Our code is public on GitHub for anyone to see
        and verify our pledge.  The only information we collect is your unique Facebook or Twitter user account ID (a
        number) in order to identify your session on our site and connect you to your posts and votes.</p>

        <p>The numbers themselves are public on Facebook and Twitter anyway, and they <em>can't</em> be used to get any
        extra data about you that isn't already public on social media.  We don't know - or want or need to know who your
        friends are, or make recommendations to them; you can do that on your own if you like CYOAG enough!  We don't need
        to know what you say or read, or who you follow, what your likes and dislikes are - or anything else about you (no
        offense)!  We just want you to be able to use our site without worrying about who is using you.  That's our
        philosophy and we believe in it!  Besides, this is just for fun, and we aim to keep it that way.</p>

      <h4 id='whySso'>So, why use social media accounts for log in?"</h4>

      <p>Fair question, I'm glad you asked!  I understand it's not everyone's cup of tea, and some people prefer to just
        create an account with a user name and password.  First of all, it's a lot easier for us (and believe it or not,
        safer) to leverage the single-sign-on (SSO) feature offered by social media giants like Facebook and Twitter, and
        CYOAG has gone the distance to ensure that all industry standard security measures are in place
        to protect even what little information we do collect, and ensure that your sign-on process and experience here are
        as secure as possible.  (You can check our SSL Labs A+ security rating
        <a class='cyoag-link' href='https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=cyoag.com'><strong>here</strong></a>!)</p>

      <p>The other reason we use social media accounts is to limit users from abusing the site by registering multiple
        accounts.  If you're desperate enough to break the rules that you are prepared to log in and out with multiple
        social media accounts, we're not going to stop you; but if we do spot people doing that, we have a ban hammer
        ready.  ;)</p>

      <h3 id='yours'>Copyright</h3>

      <h4>Your content is yours!</h4>

      <p>Guess what?  We're not jerks!  (We don't think so at least.)  We won't try to claim ownership of your content,
        that you wrote.  Of course, your chunk of the story is only part of the timeline (or trajectory, as we call it),
        but for what it's worth, we acknowledge your right to hold the copyright for anything you write on here.  The
        only thing we do ask in the form of a light Terms of Service Agreement is that you acknowledge our right to
        display the content you write for our site, on our site.  I mean... that kind of makes sense, right?  But of
        course, some people need to be told, so here ye be told.</p>

      <p>Point being, if you want to take your piece of this story and use it for your own purposes somewhere, by all
        means, go for it!  But we reserve the right to keep using what you've posted here, using our service, to keep
        the storyline together.  (You can delete your own posts if you like, but only so long as others haven't already)
        started extending a trajectory off of your storyline.)</p>

      <h4 id='theirs'>Other people's content is <em>not</em> yours!</h4>

      <p>If you post content that someone else wrote - prose from J.K. Rowling's <em>Harry Potter</em>, for example -
        you can expect to get in trouble as soon as anyone finds out.  We will surely delete it, and you may find you
        have been banned.  If you want your trajectory of this story to take a fan-fiction-ey turn, that is fine with
        me, and many content owners are permissive of common-sense practice in fan-fiction writing; but use your head,
        and don't abuse this site or push limits.</p>
