      <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>

      <p>I, Steven Kitzes, a private citizen, operate Create Your Own Adventure Game ("CYOAG", "I", "me",
        "my", "us", "we", or "our") on http://www.cyoag.com (the "Site"). This page informs you, as required by
        law, of my Privacy Policy regarding the collection, use and disclosure of the Personal Information CYOAG
        receives from users of the Site, including via connection to and integration with social media accounts.
        As mentioned above, this Privacy Policy is presented as required by law; however, CYOAG does not in
        actuality collect any Personal Information about you whatsoever, except in the case that you register
        for an account with CYOAG by linking a social media account via Facebook or Twitter, and even in that
        scenario CYOAG receives, records, and uses only your unique Facebook or Twitter identification number.
        CYOAG does not receive any other information about you, including your friends list, likes, follows,
        contact information, ability to post or act in any way on your behalf on social media, not even your
        name, because CYOAG respects you and cares about your privacy.  No offense, but CYOAG does not want or
        need to know anything else about you, and you should never post anything personal about yourself or
        anyone else on the CYOAG service (except, maybe, for your name if you really want to).</p>

      <p>For additional clarification, social media account ID numbers, on both Facebook and Twitter, are considered
        Personal Information because anyone who has these numbers can use them to find your public profile on social
        media, just as if they searched for your public account by name.  CYOAG uses these numbers only for one
        purpose, that being as a unique ID by which to distinguish you anonymously from other users, strictly within
        the context of the CYOAG service.  On principle and out of respect for you, CYOAG does its
        best to adhere to industry standards in keeping your social media ID numbers private and secure from prying
        eyes.  It is the right thing to do and CYOAG believes you deserve it.  You can learn more about what a
        Facebook ID is and what it can be used for
        <a class='cyoag-link' href='https://www.facebook.com/help/211813265517027'>here</a>.  Unfortunately, Twitter
        has not shared similar information with users, but you can learn a little bit about Twitter IDs from
        the software developer's point of view
        <a class='cyoag-link' href='https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/twitter-ids-json-and-snowflake'>here</a>.</p>

      <p>It is my legal responsibility to inform you that CYOAG uses your Personal Information only for providing
        and improving the functionality and features of this Site and for no other purpose.  By using the Site, you
        agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

      <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>

      <p>While using the Site, CYOAG will never ask you to provide us with personally identifiable information
        that can be used to contact or identify you, except as mentioned above in account registration through
        social media.  If anyone or any correspondence claiming to be in agency or representation of CYOAG asks
        for any of your personally identifiable information, except as mentioned above, they are trying to scam
        you and you should not cooperate with them.</p>

      <h4>Log Data</h4>

      <p>Some site operators collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit their site ("Log
        Data").  In addition, they use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and
        analyze this your interactions for a variety of purposes.  CYOAG does not apply any of these practices.
        In the future, I may choose to employ third party analytics and ad hosting services in order to support
        my operating costs for this Site, but for the time being you should not expect to be subject to any
        kind of tracking or monitoring while visiting the Site.</p>

      <p>CYOAG does communicate data to and from your browser, including cookies that are used to ensure the
        security and identity of your session while browsing the Site.  This information is used only to
        facilitate the delivery of features we hope you will find convenient and enjoyable, such as
        bookmarking your position on the site.  CYOAG also receives data when you explicitly send it, such as
        when you post a new chapter or vote on someone else's chapter.</p>

      <h4>Communications</h4>

      <p>CYOAG will never use your Personal Information to contact you with newsletters, marketing, or
        promotional materials, or other information.  CYOAG will communicate with you strictly through the
        context of the Site, and though I hope you will be back because you love reading and collaborating
        on CYOAG, you don't deserve to be bothered or pestered when you don't want to be.  This is not just
        a policy, it is a philosophy.</p>

      <h4>Cookies</h4>

      <p>Cookies are files with small amounts of data, including but not limited to an anonymous unique
        identifier, which is used strictly internally within the context of the Site to link your current
        browsing session to your account on CYOAG, if you have one and you are logged in.  Cookies are sent
        to your browser from a web site (in this case, CYOAG) and stored on your computer's hard drive.  They
        expire after a time, can be deleted by you manually at any time, and you can disable your browser
        from accepting cookies from websites (although many websites, including CYOAG, will not function
        fully or properly without cookies enabled).</p>

      <p>CYOAG does not use cookies to collect any information from you that CYOAG did not send to you in
        the first place in order to provide feature functionality for the Site.  As mentioned above, you can
        instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to notify you of when a cookie is being sent. However,
        if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use CYOAG.  Sorry!</p>

      <h4>Security</h4>

      <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to CYOAG, and to me, personally.  As I said
        above, this is not just a policy, but a philosophy.  But please do remember that no method of
        transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  While we strive to
        use superior, industry standard means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
        absolute security.</p>

      <h4>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h4>

      <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 1, 2017 and will remain in effect in perpetuity,
        except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect
        immediately after being posted on this page or this page's replacement, in which case the
        provisions as written in this iteration shall be retained for posterity.</p>

      <p>I reserve the right to update or change the CYOAG Privacy Policy at any time, and if concerned, you
        should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Site after we post any
        modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page or its replacement will constitute acknowledgment on
        your part of the modifications, and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
        If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by placing a prominent
        notice on our website.</p>
