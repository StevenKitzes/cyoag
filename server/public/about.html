      <p>In short, CYOAG stands for <em>Choose Your Own Adventure Game</em>.  The concept is not new; Steve, the CYOAG creator,
        borrowed the <a class='cyoag-link' href='http://www.cyoa.com'>Choose Your Own Adventure</a> idea from the books that
        many who grew up in his generation treasured as part of their childhoods.  If you're familiar with those books, this
        site works in much the same way.  (If not, you can learn more below.)  The main difference here at CYOAG is that
        everything past the first chapter is 100% user generated.  So you
        can read as much as you want, following any path you want, and if you ever have an idea for what should happen next that
        isn't already listed as an option, you can add your own paths and chapters for others to choose!</p>

      <p>If you aren't familiar with Choose Your Own Adventure books, here's the basic idea: the reader is
        presented with very short chapters for context, then gets to make a decision as to what path the story should take next.
        At the end of each chapter is a list of possible choices, each corresponding to a different chapter.  For example,
        "if the hero should pick up the magic crown, turn to page 14; if the hero should ready his sword, turn to
        page 29."  The reader wouldn't read every chapter in the order they were printed, but would decide the flow of the story
        and read the chapters along that flow to see how their decisions panned out.  There were many different paths with many
        possible trajectories and endings each time the reader picked up the book.  Steve loved reading these
        Choose Your Own Adventure books and discovering the outcomes that could be reached by reading again and making different
        choices.</p>

      <p>Now, later in life, Steve has come to love writing as much as he loves reading.  Having grown into a career in
        software development, and remembering his love of the famous Choose Your Own Adventure series of books, he decided
        it would be a great expression of his admiration, and a fantastic potential side project, to build a website that
        combines all of these loves, memories, and nostalgia into one passion project.  CYOAG is, thus, a web app that proposes
        to let users read <em>and create</em> content for a Choose Your Own Adventure style story creation environment online.
        CYOAG is not the first to try this idea in an online format, either, but Steve hopes his rendition will demonstrate
        superior quality due to his dedication and passion for the project.</p>

      <p>Steve has been asked many times, what makes CYOAG a "game," since CYOAG is not competitive.  Chapters
        can be voted on, so they can compete in that respect; but not every game is, or needs to be,
        competitive!  Think of CYOAG as a collaborative effort, a game in which everyone works together toward the end of
        creating the best, most riveting, interesting, rewarding story reading and writing experience possible!</p>

      <h4 id='rules'>The Technical Rules of the "Game"</h4>

      <span id='cyoag-rules-block'>

        <p>So, how do you play?  How is this a "game" at all?  I consider this to be a game because it's fun (hopefully),
          interactive, collaborative, and has rules.  There is a voting system, so some of the best chapter submissions
          will gain more visibility, but there are no "winners" and no "losers," and every chapter submission will always
          have the chance to be seen.  All the rules are outlined here as a quick reference.</p>

        <p>You can read the story without an account, but you must be logged in with an anonymous, registered account to
          participate by contributing content and voting.<br />
          <span class='cyoag-note'><strong>Why?</strong> This helps keep the site organized, and helps me provide features
          (some coming soon) such as displaying the author's pen name on their chapter posts, allowing you to manage, delete,
          and edit your posts and saved drafts, letting you view all posts by a given author by pen name, etc.  It also
          discourages people from trying to break the parent/sibling chapter rules (see below).</span></p>

        <p>Path Teaser snippets must be <strong>at least 4</strong> and <strong>at most 100</strong> characters in length.<br />
          <span class='cyoag-note'><strong>Why?</strong> You can craft short, punchy teasers ("RUN!"), but
          you can also expand your ideas for detail if needed ("Run for cover, it's about to blow!").  You shouldn't ramble
          in your Path Teasers or use them as a way of padding chapter content.</span></p>

        <p>Chapter Body Content snippets must be <strong>at least 500</strong> and <strong>at most 2,500</strong> characters
          in length.<br />
          <span class='cyoag-note'><strong>Why?</strong> You can write short chapter segments that are to the point, or you can
          write longer segments that span multiple screens.  If your entire chapter can fit in the space of a Twitter post,
          it isn't right for this venue; likewise, you shouldn't ramble on for too long.  The whole point of this project is
          that others will have a chance to riff off of your chapter, so try not to stress over incomplete ideas.</span></p>

        <p>You may not post Path Teasers leading to chapters that follow after your own chapters (the parent chapter rule).<br />
          <span class='cyoag-note'><strong>Why?</strong> The idea here is that you write a chapter to follow someone else's
          chapter, so that you can expand on their ideas and add your own ideas to the mix and nudge (not force) the story
          in a new direction.  If you want to write every chapter of your own story, you can do that anywhere, you don't
          need to do it here; the point of this project is collaboration, so let others step in and follow in your
          footsteps!</span></p>

        <p>You may not post multiple Path Teasers off of the same source chapter (the sibling chapter rule).<br />
          <span class='cyoag-note'><strong>Why?</strong> It's great that you have so many ideas, and that the source chapter
          inspired you to such a degree, but this is about collaboration and letting everyone have their ideas seen.  If you
          write several paths off of a single source chapter, other people's Path Teasers will be less likely to be displayed
          and picked by readers.</span></p>

        <p>The highest voted Path Teaser from each chapter will be displayed first, but all other Path Teasers still have an
          equal chance to be seen and read by readers.<br />
          <span class='cyoag-note'><strong>Why/how?</strong> The paths and chapters that are best loved by the community
          deserve to be rewarded by prominent placement among other paths.  However, less popular (or newer paths that just
          haven't had time to amass votes) also deserve a chance to be seen.  Therefore, the most popular Path Teaser will
          always be displayed first among available paths (or a random choice from among those that are tied for most
          popular), and then a random assortment of up to three of the remaining Path Teasers will be shown, in random
          order.  Every path in the remaining set has an equal chance to be shown.  You have the option to expand the Path
          Teaser list so that you can see <em>all</em> of the paths leading out of the chapter you're currently viewing, in
          which case all available paths will be sorted by popularity.</span></p>
