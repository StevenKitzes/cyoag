      <p>CYOAG stands for <em>Choose Your Own Adventure Game</em>.  The concept is not new; Steve, the CYOAG developer, borrowed
        the <a href='http://www.cyoa.com'>Choose Your Own Adventure</a> idea from the books that many of those who grew up in
        his generation treasured as part of their childhoods.  The basic idea behind these books was that you would be
        presented with very short chapters for context; then you'd get to pick from a handful of options that would lead to
        different page numbers, ultimately resulting in different paths through a story that always started the same, but had
        many possible trajectories and endings. Steve loved reading these Choose Your Own Adventure books and discovering the
        variable outcomes that could be reached.</p>

      <p>Now, later in life, Steve has come to love writing as much as he loves reading.  Having grown into a career in
        software development, and remembering his love of the famous Choose Your Own Adventure series of books, he decided
        it would be a great expression of his admiration, and a fantastic potential side project, to build a website that
        combines all of these loves, memories, and nostalgia into one passion project.  CYOAG is, thus, a web app that proposes
        to let users read <em>and create</em> content for a Choose Your Own Adventure style story creation environment online.
        CYOAG is not the first to try this idea in an online format, either, but Steve hopes his rendition will demonstrate
        superior quality due to his dedication and passion for the project.</p>

      <p>Steve has been asked many times, what makes CYOAG a "game."  True, CYOAG is not competitive, although given chapter
        contributions can be voted on, and surpass each other in that respect.  But not every game is, or needs to be,
        competitive!  Think of CYOAG as a collaborative effort, a game in which everyone works together toward the end of
        creating the best, most riveting, interesting, rewarding story reading and writing experience possible!</p>
