      <p>Steve is a software developer and business IT consultant by trade.  He works for <a href='http://www.parivedasolutions.com'>
        Pariveda Solutions</a>, an excellent company and great place to work.  (No, he's not just saying that, and no one had to ask
        him to!)</p>
      <p>In May of 2016, Steve graduated as an M.S. in Computer Science with departmental honors from <a href='http://www.csun.edu'>
        Cal State Northridge</a>.  It was a long, painful, but worthwhile battle getting through that program while
        accepting over a year's worth of extensions to an enjoyable, educational, and profitable internship experience with
        <a href='https://www.bostonscientific.com'>Boston Scientific</a>.</p>
      <p>While working on his Master's and internship work, Steve also worked on side projects
        toward the goal of growing in his career as a professional software engineer.  These include
        CYOAG, the site you're visiting now, as well as <a href='http://stevenkitzes.github.io/howmany'>How Many Drinks</a>,
        a simple-but-effective static website to help beer lovers keep their drinking habits in perspective (also
        <a href='http://github.com/stevenkitzes/howmany'>hosted on GitHub</a>).</p>
      <p>There is more to Steve than just his value as a software developer (thank goodness).  He also enjoys geeking out over
        sci-fi and fantasy in print, film, TV, video games, and other formats; loves (loves) playing Ultimate Frisbee; feels at
        home on motorcycle touring trips; plays guitar from time to time; deals semi-professionally in puns; and is working on
        his second novel.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in following or contacting Steve, you can reach him on his oft neglected (but always monitored)
        Twitter account, <a href='http://www.twitter.com/tknkldfklty'>@tknkldfklty</a>.</p>
