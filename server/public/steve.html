      <p>Steve is a software developer and business IT consultant by trade.  He works for
        <a class='cyoag-link' href='http://www.parivedasolutions.com'>Pariveda Solutions</a>, an excellent company.  It is great, he likes it.</p>
      <p>In May of 2016, Steve graduated as an M.S. in Computer Science with departmental honors from
        <a class='cyoag-link' href='http://www.csun.edu'>Cal State Northridge</a>.  During the program, Steve was offered over a year's worth of extensions to, and won awards for his work at, an internship with <a class='cyoag-link' href='https://www.bostonscientific.com'>Boston
        Scientific</a>.  That was great, too.</p>
      <p>While all that was going on, Steve also worked on side projects
        to build his skills toward a career as a professional software engineer.  These include
        CYOAG, the site you're visiting now, as well as <a class='cyoag-link' href='http://stevenkitzes.github.io/howmany'>How
        Many Drinks</a>, a simple website to help beer lovers keep their drinking habits in perspective
        (also <a class='cyoag-link' href='http://github.com/stevenkitzes/howmany'>hosted on GitHub</a>).</p>
      <p>Steve also enjoys
        sci-fi and fantasy in print, film, TV, video games, and other formats; playing Ultimate Frisbee; riding
        his motorcycle; playing guitar (used to, anyway); dealing semi-professionally in puns; and working on
        his second novel (due some time in 2053 at this rate if he is lucky).</p>
      <p>If you're interested in following or contacting Steve, you can reach him on his oft neglected (but always monitored)
        Twitter account, <a class='cyoag-link' href='http://www.twitter.com/tknkldfklty'>@tknkldfklty</a>.</p>
